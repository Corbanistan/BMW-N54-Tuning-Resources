**WARNING: As of MHD version 3.0+, tons of things have changed (along with a new updated official XDF). I'm still in the process of going through all the changes however I've finished porting most of my added tables from the legacy XDF to the new one for I8A0S. That XDF is up but I'm going to have to find more time to go through everything and continue updates and polish for version 3.0+.**

# BMW-N54-Tuning-Resources
Work-in-progress XDF definitions file for N54 DMEs, and possibly more resources for backyard tuners in the future.

Currently I only have an I8A0S MSD80 XDF file available to share due to the fact that my car has this version of DME, and I don't have the need to replace it anytime soon. In the future, I hope to have XDF files available to all other DME revisions hopefully with the help of the community. So until then, tables have been posted all over the forums for the MSD81.

As stated, I hope to grow this repository with the help of the community into a regularly-maintained one-stop place for everything you would need to make your N54 go even faster. Things like guides, .BINs, definitions files, etc. "Regularly maintained" is key here because sometimes resources for this platform are slow to be updated and improved.

If anyone has additions, corrections, or other materials they'd like to see here, feel free to submit it.

A FAIR WARNING: my XDFs are constantly being changed and improved and I origionally never thought that I would be sharing it with the public. Tables contained within may have errors. Not everything has been tested. Do your research before messing with anything on your car. Keep a backup of your stock BIN file. Also, I have been slowly updating table names and descriptions to be accurate and more informative. Not all tables have been updated yet, so again, there may be errors.
