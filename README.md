**NOTE: My N54 BMW is no longer with me, meaning I won't be working on this repo or N54 tuning anymore unless I buy another. So unfortunately, I'm declaring this repo NO LONGER MAINTAINED. MHD updates or community developments could change the usability of the files in this repo. I had big plans for this repo but the loss of my BMW was sudden and I don't have the time to keep up with N54 developments unless I have one in my garage. Thank you to everyone involved in the N54 tuning community, especially those listed below in the credits. This repo will be kept up here for public use and to help owners who want to get more out of this platform.**

**NOTE: Be careful choosing which files to use. There are changes with MHD 3.0+, and you need to use the correct XDF. If you need files for older versions, go to the "Legacy" folder. I will not be updating any legacy files from here on out.**

# BMW N54 Tuning Resources
Work-in-progress XDF definitions file for N54 DMEs, and possibly more resources for backyard tuners in the future.

Currently I only have an I8A0S MSD80 XDF file available to share due to the fact that my car has this version of DME, and I don't have the need to replace it anytime soon. In the future, I hope to have XDF files available to all other DME revisions hopefully with the help of the community. So until then, tables have been posted all over the forums for the MSD81.

As stated, I hope to grow this repository with the help of the community into a regularly-maintained one-stop place for everything you would need to make your N54 go even faster. Things like guides, manuals, .BINs, definitions files, etc. "Regularly maintained" is key here because sometimes resources for this platform are slow to be updated and improved.

If anyone has additions, corrections, or other materials they'd like to see here, feel free to submit it.

For Motiv & FlexFuel Firmware, as well as files for non-N54 BMWs, please see https://github.com/dmacpro91/BMW-XDFs.

***A FAIR WARNING:*** my XDFs are constantly being changed and improved and I origionally never thought that I would be sharing it with the public. Tables contained within may have errors. Not everything has been tested. Do your research before messing with anything on your car. Keep a backup of your stock BIN file. Also, I have been slowly updating table names and descriptions to be accurate and more informative. Not all tables have been updated yet, so again, there may be errors or a lack of description.
