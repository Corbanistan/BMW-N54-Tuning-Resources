# N5X Tuning Spreadsheet
This is the well known Excel spreadsheet put together by V8Bait years ago. If you need some assistance with tuning your own car, this will help.

In the future I plan to author an updated document for this platform with corrections that have been made since this spreadsheet was published.

**NOTE: Some of the information contained within this spreadsheet is outdated as of now. As tuning for this platform has progressed, there have been improvements and changes to how things are done. Do research and ask questions on the forums before you mess with anything you aren't sure about.**
